the
economy
's
temperature
will
be
taken
from
several
vantage
points
this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
output
,
housing
and
inflation
.

the
most
troublesome
report
may
be
the
august
merchandise
trade
deficit
due
out
tomorrow
.

the
trade
gap
is
expected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
billion
from
july
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
survey
by
mms
international
,
a
unit
of
mcgraw-hill
inc.
,
new
york
.

thursday
's
report
on
the
september
consumer
price
index
is
expected
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
friday
in
the
producer
price
index
.

that
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason
the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

economists
are
divided
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength
they
expect
to
see
in
september
reports
on
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
,
also
due
tomorrow
.

meanwhile
,
september
housing
starts
,
due
wednesday
,
are
thought
to
have
inched
upward
.

``
there
's
a
possibility
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
said
michael
englund
,
director
of
research
at
mms
.

a
widening
of
the
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbate
trade
problems
--
but
the
dollar
weakened
friday
as
stocks
plummeted
.

in
any
event
,
mr.
englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
narrowing
the
trade
gap
have
already
been
made
.

``
trade
is
definitely
going
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
improvement
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
august
,
but
probably
not
enough
to
offset
the
jump
in
imports
,
economists
said
.

views
on
manufacturing
strength
are
split
between
economists
who
read
september
's
low
level
of
factory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those
who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
employment
figures
in
their
calculations
.

the
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industrial
output
number
underscores
the
differences
:
the
forecasts
run
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
increase
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
mms
.

a
rebound
in
energy
prices
,
which
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
consumer
price
report
.

the
consensus
view
expects
a
0.4
%
increase
in
the
september
cpi
after
a
flat
reading
in
august
.

robert
h.
chandross
,
an
economist
for
lloyd
's
bank
in
new
york
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderate
gain
in
the
cpi
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
ppi
,
and
at
the
cpi
level
they
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
.

food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanged
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
gary
ciminero
,
economist
at
fleet\/norstar
financial
group
.

he
also
says
he
thinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
excludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strong
last
month
.

he
expects
a
gain
of
as
much
as
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
summer
of
far
smaller
increases
.

housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
august
's
annual
pace
of
1,350,000
units
.

economists
say
an
august
rebound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
signaled
an
increase
in
september
starts
,
though
activity
remains
fairly
modest
by
historical
standards
.

assuming
the
stock
market
does
n't
crash
again
and
completely
discredit
yuppies
and
trading
rooms
,
american
television
audiences
in
a
few
months
may
be
seeing
britain
's
concept
of
both
.

``
capital
city
''
is
a
weekly
series
that
premiered
here
three
weeks
ago
amid
unprecedented
hype
by
its
producer
,
thames
television
.

the
early
episodes
make
you
long
for
a
rerun
of
the
crash
of
1987
.

let
's
make
that
1929
,
just
to
be
sure
.

according
to
the
program
's
publicity
prospectus
,
``
capital
city
,
''
set
at
shane
longman
,
a
fictional
mid-sized
securities
firm
with
#
500
million
capital
,
``
follows
the
fortunes
of
a
close-knit
team
of
young
,
high-flying
dealers
,
hired
for
their
particular
blend
of
style
,
genius
and
energy
.

but
with
all
the
money
and
glamour
of
high
finance
come
the
relentless
pressures
to
do
well
;
pressure
to
pull
off
another
million
before
lunch
;
pressure
to
anticipate
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
...
''

you
need
n't
be
a
high-powered
securities
lawyer
to
realize
the
prospectus
is
guilty
of
less
than
full
disclosure
.

the
slickly
produced
series
has
been
criticized
by
london
's
financial
cognoscenti
as
inaccurate
in
detail
,
but
its
major
weakness
is
its
unrealistic
depiction
of
the
characters
'
professional
and
private
lives
.

turned
loose
in
shane
longman
's
trading
room
,
the
yuppie
dealers
do
little
right
.

judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in
the
early
episodes
,
shane
longman
's
capital
should
be
just
about
exhausted
by
the
final
13th
week
.

in
the
opening
episode
we
learn
that
michelle
,
a
junior
bond
trader
,
has
indeed
pulled
off
another
million
before
lunch
.
